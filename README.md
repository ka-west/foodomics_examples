## FoodOmics Analysis Examples

We used [Reference Data-Driven Metabolomics](https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/tutorials/rdd/) to generate diet profiles (food abundance tables) from clinical samples. This gives us a readout of which foods individuals may have consumed prior to sampling. Below are some examples of how we have analyzed this data in certain clinical contexts.

### Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)

* [Diet variation across datasets](https://ka-west.github.io/foodomics_examples/IBD/notebooks/IBD_all_datasets.html)
* [Foods correlated with disease severity](https://ka-west.github.io/foodomics_examples/IBD/notebooks/IBD_symptom_severity_foods.html)

### Alzheimer's Disease

* [ADNI: Diet variation across cohort](https://ka-west.github.io/foodomics_examples/Alzheimers/notebooks/ADNI_foodomics_overall_diet_profile.html)
* [ADNI: Foods associated with cognition](https://ka-west.github.io/foodomics_examples/Alzheimers/notebooks/ADNI_individual_foods_analysis.html)
* [BEAM: Diet cross-over longitudinal models](https://ka-west.github.io/foodomics_examples/Alzheimers/notebooks/BEAM_longitudinal_diet_profiles.html)

### Other
* [GI Tube study](https://ka-west.github.io/foodomics_examples/Other/notebooks/GI_Tube_GFOP.html)
